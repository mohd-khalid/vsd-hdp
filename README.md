# VSD-HDP
üöÄ This repository is created as part of the VLSI System Design - Hardware Design Program (VSD-HDP). It will provide an inclusive and detailed documentation of the tasks and milestones achieved throughout this internship, which will ultimately lead to a full RTL2GDS tapeout-ready chip design.



## Day 0
  This is the day prior to the actual program start to ensure the following:

  ####  System Specs Check ‚ö°Ô∏è
  - 400 GB SSD | 8 GB RAM | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Not on a virtul Machine)
  #### Create the Github repository ‚úÖ
  - [Github üîó](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/)
  ####  EDA tools installation üõ†
  The entirety of the project will be done using free open-source software
  - Yosys, iverilog and GTKWave will be installed initially.
  - Other tools will be introduced in later stages of the project (OpenSTA, NGSpice, Magic, OpenLANE)
