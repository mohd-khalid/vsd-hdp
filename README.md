# üöÄ  VSD-HDP
This repository is created as part of the [VLSI System Design - Hardware Design Program (VSD-HDP)](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/hdp/). It will provide an inclusive and detailed documentation of the tasks and milestones achieved throughout this internship, which will ultimately lead to a full RTL2GDS tapeout-ready chip design.



## RISC-V 32-bit CPU Core (RV32I)

The design that we will carry out the entire design flow on is a RISC-V 32-bit CPU Core with 5 stages of pipelining that executes arithmetic, logical, branching and memory access operations. The used instruction set ISA is the open-source RISC-V in its RV32I variation.

## Day 1

###  RTL Design and Synthesis

The RTL design represents the implementation of certain specs in the form of a verilog file(s). In order to ensure that our RTL matches the desired spec, we simulate the design functionalities using simulators. The simulating tool used throughout this project is iverilog.

- #### Simulation
The simulation is carried out by inputting a stimulus (test_vectors) to the system and observing how the produced output matches the chip specs. The setup on which the stimuli are generated, applied and observed as they output the design is the Testbench (TB).

![Screenshot from 2024-01-25 16-59-25](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/85354b14-1f05-4a68-8659-af694c03c66e)

However, the TB itself has no primary input or output signals. The simulator receives inputs and evaluates the output accordingly. If the input didn't change, the output will remain unchanged as well.

-  ####  iverilog-based Simulation Flow

iverilog reads both the design and the Testbench, once the inputs change, iverilog will dump the change in the output, resulting in a .vcd format file (Value Change Dump). The vcd file is then visualized and displayed as a waveform using another tool called GTKWave.

![Screenshot from 2024-01-25 16-59-40](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/520ab252-c137-4c0e-93fd-d9babd637ab0)

The Testbench instantiates the design, the design instance of the TB is called: uut (or dut), short for [Unit (or Design) Under test].


### [Lab] SKY130RTL - Intro to iverilog and GTKWave

This lab will delve into simulateion of a simple verilog design (2:1 Multiplexer), verifying the design, and viewing it as a waveform on GTKWave. Used tools have been installed ealier.
- ### Lab 1
We initiate be cloning the Github repository that includes the verilog RTL designs, their corresponding Testbenches and synthesis-related standard liberaries.

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```
We clone the repo and navigate through the files:

![Screenshot from 2024-01-22 23-11-24](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/54983c4b-13ff-4abf-b491-ed5985ba138d)

- ### Lab 2: Introducing iverilog and GTKWave
These lab aims at applying the previously demonstrated processes of simulating and visualizing the design and its Testbenche using iverilog and GTKWave, respectively.

#### Relevant Commands
To upload a design (design.v) and its TB (tb_design.v) to iverilog: `read_verilog design.v tb_design_mux.v`

For our 2:1 Multiplexer we use:

```bash
read_verilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

![Screenshot from 2024-01-22 23-30-431](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/bbe413be-53fc-40b7-bbe4-6995f0b8f91b)

We notice a new file created in the same directory named: `a.out` Executing this newly created file (using the comand `./a.out`) will generate, the previously explained, .vcd file (called: tb_good_mux.vcd).

Eventually, we load the resulting VCD  to our wave viewer GTKWave using the command:

```bash
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```
![Screenshot from 2024-01-22 23-30-43](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/d667ee41-8fe9-446f-8c16-88eed5c853d9)



Once the command runs, a new winsow will pop up of the GTKWave, it shows the waveforms of all the signals of the chip: inputs `i1, i0 and sel` and outputs `y` and how the input changes will affect the  output.

![Screenshot from 2024-01-22 23-39-05](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/44345433-7a49-430d-87bb-163e1cf1197b)


### Design Synthesis

Synthesis is the process of converting an RTL design into a netlist. The synthesizer used in this project is the open-source tool: Yosys.

Similar to iverilog, Yosys reads two files, the design and the standard cell library (.lib), and produces the netlist, which is the design representation in the form of standard cells in (.lib).



 #### Relevant Yosys commands: 

  - To read the design file: `read_verilog`

  - To read the (.lib) file: `read_liberty`

  - To generate the netlist file: `write_verilog`


![Screenshot from 2024-01-26 01-34-36](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/261ca6c5-675b-47ef-9302-8f63de8df433)


#### Synthesis Verification

The same approach of verifying RTL is followed. We provide the iverilog simulator with the netlist file and the corresponding TB, and consequently get the .vcd file output to be run on GTKWave.


![Screenshot from 2024-01-26 02-07-29](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/228a50d2-ef67-4a71-8982-0007cf282745)


The waveform must match the output observed during the RTL simulation. Since the set of primary inputs and outputs are the same on both the RTL and netlist, the same testbench can be used to verify both.

#### Logic Synthesis 

The RTL code is a behavioral representation of a certain specifications. Synthesis is translating that RTL code to Gate Leve, where the RTL code is mapped to actual gates and interconnections between these gates. The generated file that contains this data (gates and connections) is called a netlist.
The synthesis tool receives the RTL along with a Front End Lib and gives out the netlist.


![Screenshot from 2024-01-26 02-10-56](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/6c4032d6-4c69-4287-883f-38d6b0aa3069)


- Libraries `.lib` 

Contain a collection of logical modules. It contains basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.). It also contains different variations of the same gate in terms of various parameters e.g. number of inputs, performance (slow, fast gate), etc.

The combinational delay in the logic path raises the need for different variations of the same gate.

The clock cycle time should be long enough to accommodate all of the propagation delay of the flip-flops (FF), the combinational delay and the setup delay. The sum of these delays must be shorter than the clk cycle. The shorter the clock cycle `(T_clk)` the higher the frequency `(f_clk)`.  To ensure better performance we aim to reduce the delays to obtain a high frequency circuit. However, there is still a need for slower circuits to ensure we don't violate the hold timings `(T_hold)`. This set of various speed gate variations forms the `.lib`.

The load in a digital IC is a capacitor. How fast this capacitor charges and discharges determines the gate delay. In order to speed up the charging process we need to supply the capacitor with higher amperage. This is obtained using wider transistors. However, this short delay was attained at cost of area (wide transistors) and power (greater consumption). Whereas narrow transistors will be more efficient in terms of area and power, but longer delays in contrast.

- #### Cell Selection Trade-offs

The synthesizer needs to optimize the cells selection for logic circuits implementation. On one hand,  excessive use of fast cells will increase the chip area and power consumption along with Hold time violations. On the other hand, using slow cells solely will result in a sluggish circuit that performs poorly. Hence, we use ‚Äúconstraints‚Äù to optimize the synthesizer choice of cells.



### [Lab] SKY130RTL D1SK4 - Yosys and SKY130 PDKs

To synthesize our design using Yosys, we, firstly, invoke yosys

```bash
yosys
```


Then, we read our library and (.lib file) and our design (verilog file):

```bash
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog good_mux.v
```

We'll get the following message `Successfully finished Verilog frontend`. 
Then we synthesize our design, using `synth -top <design_name>`

```bash
synth -top good_mux
```



Once the process is done, we get brief statistics of our design components. Then we generate our netlist using `abc -liberty` followed by our `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib ` directory, we can use an absolute or relative path:

```bash
abc -liberty .. /lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib ![1](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/ecfa772b-1e15-4ce7-8992-ab29a179f275)

```

Our design is now converted into actual gates and wires, using the cells present in `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`. and a breif of the used cells is provided.

![2](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/c674fcd9-feca-4c2c-9b34-09be927a02f6)


![3](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/b0ccf8f3-58f7-46ae-a918-f660456d8ab1)




To get a graphical representation that illustrate our design, command `show` is used.

![4](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/8d4def02-0f99-4f7c-bda8-3611c13b334a)


Eventually, to generate our netlist file `write_verilog good_mux_netlist.v` as stated before. this will produce a detailed verilog file, to have a more concise version we use:

```bash
write_verilog -noattr good_mux_netlist.v
```


![5](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/e331932a-e090-4017-bb3f-ecb411b058b0)



The following verilog file `good_mux_netlist.v` was created:

```verilog

/* Generated by Yosys 0.37+21 (git sha1 8649e3066, gcc 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2 -fPIC -Os) */

module good_mux(i0, i1, sel, y);
  wire _0_;
  wire _1_;
  wire _2_;
  wire _3_;
  input i0;
  wire i0;
  input i1;
  wire i1;
  input sel;
  wire sel;
  output y;
  wire y;
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux2_1 _4_ (
    .A0(_0_),
    .A1(_1_),
    .S(_2_),
    .X(_3_)
  );
  assign _0_ = i0;
  assign _1_ = i1;
  assign _2_ = sel;
  assign y = _3_;
endmodule

```


## Day 2


### Timing Libraries

Libraries content is described in terms of three critical parameters and that is Process, Voltage and Temperature (PVT). PVT describes the variations due fabrication, voltage and temperature and how the chip will function under these circumstances. The library file shows these operation conditions in the first line: `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`.

- `tt` typical Process 

- `025C` Temperature

- `1v80` Voltage 


It also contains data about used technology (CMOS in our case) and the measurement units used for all relevant quantities.


For each cell, the library states the data about power leakage  area, input pins (its capacitance, power, etc.), power port, timing and more for all the possible input combinations to that cell.

An example of a cell might be a simple 2-input AND gate in the `.lib`, here is a brief sample of the data it contains:

```lib
 cell ("sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0") {
        leakage_power () {
            value : 0.0021372000;
            when : "!A&B";
        }
        leakage_power () {
            value : 0.0018183000;
            when : "!A&!B";
        }
        leakage_power () {
            value : 0.0015938000;
            when : "A&B";
        }
        leakage_power () {
            value : 0.0021392000;
            when : "A&!B";
        }
        area : 6.2560000000;

```
The power leakage  info is calculated for all the 4 possible input combinations to that gate.

The verilog model of this cell can be found in `..my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v`

#### Verilog model

```verilog
`ifndef SKY130_FD_SC_HD__AND2_0_V
`define SKY130_FD_SC_HD__AND2_0_V

/**
 * and2: 2-input AND.
 * Verilog wrapper for and2 with size of 0 
 * WARNING: This file is autogenerated, do not modify directly!
 */
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
`default_nettype none

`ifdef USE_POWER_PINS
/*********************************/

`celldefine
module sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 (
    X   ,
    A   ,
    B   ,
    VPWR,
    VGND,
    VPB ,
    VNB
);

    output X   ;
    input  A   ;
    input  B   ;
    input  VPWR;
    input  VGND;
    input  VPB ;
    input  VNB ;
    sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2 base (
        .X(X),
        .A(A),
        .B(B),
        .VPWR(VPWR),
        .VGND(VGND),
        .VPB(VPB),
        .VNB(VNB)
    );

endmodule
`endcelldefine
```









We also notice different variations of the 2-input AND gate in our `.lib`

```verilog
    cell ("sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0") {
        leakage_power () {
            value : 0.0021372000;
            when : "!A&B";
        }
        area : 6.2560000000;
```

```verilog
    cell ("sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_2") {
        leakage_power () {
            value : 0.0039778000;
            when : "!A&B";
        }
        area : 7.5072000000;
```
```verilog
    cell ("sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_4") {
        leakage_power () {
            value : 0.0045182000;
            when : "!A&B";
        }
        area : 8.7584000000;
```

We observe an increase in power leakage and area, implying wider transistors and consequently faster cell performance as explained previously.

### Hierarchical vs. Flat Synthesis

The explore the different synthesis approaches, we will use a simple design that includes two sub-modules instantiated by a main module. Our design `multiple_modules.v` consists of two simple 2-input gates modules `sub_module1` and `sub_module2`, and the overall design is a 3-input single-output module `multiple_modules`:


```verilog
module sub_module2 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a | b;
endmodule

module sub_module1 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a&b;
endmodule


module multiple_modules (input a, input b, input c , output y);
	wire net1;
	sub_module1 u1(.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1));  //net1 = a&b
	sub_module2 u2(.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));  //y = net1|c ,ie y = a&b + c;
endmodule
```

We invoke Yosys, read our design and library, synthesize the design then map it to our SKY130 technology:

```bash
yosys
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog multiple_modules.v
synth -top multiple_modules
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```

And to view our design `show multiple_modules`:


![1](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/4694e0ab-382b-49c2-9596-5c1669d8436b)


hierarchy of our design modules after synthesis as shown. To write out the netlist:

```bash
write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_hier.v
```

The following verilog file was generated:

```verilog
/* Generated by Yosys 0.37+21 (git sha1 8649e3066, gcc 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2 -fPIC -Os) */

module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
  input a;
  wire a;
  input b;
  wire b;
  input c;
  wire c;
  wire net1;
  output y;
  wire y;
  sub_module1 u1 (
    .a(a),
    .b(b),
    .y(net1)
  );
  sub_module2 u2 (
    .a(net1),
    .b(c),
    .y(y)
  );
endmodule

module sub_module1(a, b, y);
  wire _0_;
  wire _1_;
  wire _2_;
  input a;
  wire a;
  input b;
  wire b;
  output y;
  wire y;
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _3_ (
    .A(_1_),
    .B(_0_),
    .X(_2_)
  );
  assign _1_ = b;
  assign _0_ = a;
  assign y = _2_;
endmodule

module sub_module2(a, b, y);
  wire _0_;
  wire _1_;
  wire _2_;
  input a;
  wire a;
  input b;
  wire b;
  output y;
  wire y;
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__or2_0 _3_ (
    .A(_1_),
    .B(_0_),
    .X(_2_)
  );
  assign _1_ = b;
  assign _0_ = a;
  assign y = _2_;
endmodule
```
This represents a **Hierarchical** netlist. Where the hierarchy of modules is preserved. To a the flat-synthesis netlist we use the command `flatten` then generate the netlist verilog:

```bash
flatten
write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_flat.v
```

The design was flattened out into a single module, without any submodules:

```verilog
/* Generated by Yosys 0.37+21 (git sha1 8649e3066, gcc 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2 -fPIC -Os) */

module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
  wire _0_;
  wire _1_;
  wire _2_;
  wire _3_;
  wire _4_;
  wire _5_;
  input a;
  wire a;
  input b;
  wire b;
  input c;
  wire c;
  wire net1;
  wire \u1.a ;
  wire \u1.b ;
  wire \u1.y ;
  wire \u2.a ;
  wire \u2.b ;
  wire \u2.y ;
  output y;
  wire y;
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _6_ (
    .A(_1_),
    .B(_0_),
    .X(_2_)
  );
  sky130_fd_sc_hd__or2_0 _7_ (
    .A(_4_),
    .B(_3_),
    .X(_5_)
  );
  assign _4_ = \u2.b ;
  assign _3_ = \u2.a ;
  assign \u2.y  = _5_;
  assign \u2.a  = net1;
  assign \u2.b  = c;
  assign y = \u2.y ;
  assign _1_ = \u1.b ;
  assign _0_ = \u1.a ;
  assign \u1.y  = _2_;
  assign \u1.a  = a;
  assign \u1.b  = b;
  assign net1 = \u1.y ;
endmodule
```

![2](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/ad82538a-cf76-46fb-b1bc-0058a7e23239)



It is also possible to synthesize a submodule individually. 

```bash
read_liberty -lib  ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog multiple_modules.v
synth -top sub_module1
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
show
```

![3](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/35043ae0-804b-4c67-b761-ab31ad77eb15)



This might be for 2 reasons:
- There are multiple instances of the same module. Hence, it is optimal to synthesize it once and reuse the netlist.
- It can be used as a **Divide & Conquer** approach in complex designs; to make the synthesis process more efficient.


### Flops Coding Styles and Optimization

Combinational circuits inherently have a delay issue. The change in input cause the output to change **after** the propagation delay, causing the output to glitch in mult-stage circuits. This raises the need to storage elements (i.e. Flops) to stabilize input and output signals by shielding the flop output (Q) from input changes (d). We also use set/reset signals as well to initialize the flop, otherwise if the initial flop state was unknown the output would be useless.


- #### Coding Styles

There is different variations of flops in terms of the set/reset signals and synchronicity/asynchronicity. The following will show simulation and synthesis of a d-FlipFlop (dFF) with:
- asynchronous reset
- asynchronous set
- synchronous reset

We will view the waveform and observe how the set/reset signal affect the output **Q** with respect the clock signal **clk**.

### [Lab] SKY130RTL - Flop Synthesis and Simulation

- **Asynchronous reset dFF**

```verilog
module dff_asyncres ( input clk ,  input async_reset , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
begin
	if(async_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
```

To simulate our design, we invoke `iverilog` and use the following commands:

```bash
iverilog dff_asyncres.v tb_dff_asyncres.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_asyncres.vcd
```

Output **Q** was immediately reset to **Low**, before the next  `clk` edge

To synthesize the design, we invoke `yosys` and command as follow:

```bash
yosys
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```
**Note:** We used the same approach except for the command `dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib` which determines the flop library to be used as it might be sepreate in some technologies. However, we use the same library for standard cells and flops.

## Day 3
### Combinational and Sequential Optmizations

Combinational circuits inherently have a delay issue. The change in input cause the output to change **after** the propagation delay, causing the output to glitch in mult-stage circuits. This raises the need to storage elements (i.e. Flops) to stabilize input and output signals by shielding the flop output (Q) from input changes (d). We also use set/reset signals as well to initialize the flop, otherwise if the initial flop state was unknown the output would be useless.

- Combinational optimization
We aim at squeezing the logic into the optimum design in terms of area and power consumption, using various techniques, for example:
**Constant propagation:** Using straightforward techniques like K-maps and Quine-McLusky. Results in less transistor count and consequently less area and power demand.
**Boolean logic optimization:** By algebraically simplifying the boolean equation.

- Sequential optimization
There is basic techniques (e.g. constant propagation) and advanced approaches such as state optimization, Sequential logic cloning (Floor plan aware synthesis) and Retiming

### [Lab] SKY130RTL - Combinational Logic Optimizations

The following are four combinantional designs named `opt_check` that will be synthisized then optimized from a multi-muliplexer designs to a single gate design. 

- For optimizing a new command is introduced: `opt_clean`, according to **Yosys Command line reference** it identifies wires and cells that are unused and removes them. We will use the command along with `-purge` which removes internal nets if they have a public name.

### [Lab] SKY130RTL - Sequential Logic Optimizations

The following will show how the synthesizer optimizes sequential systems, named `dff_const.v`, in case of constant propagation, and removes unnecessary flops.




#### 1. dff_const1.v

- Verilog Code 

```verilog
module dff_const1(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else
		q <= 1'b1;
end
endmodule
```

- Simulation and Synthesis
```bash
iverilog dff_const1.v tb_dff_const1.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_const1.vcd
```
- Waveform

It shows how the flop did not toggle immediately to **High** but waited untill the `clk` edge.

```bash
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog dff_const1.v
synth -top dff_const1
dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

The system cannot be reduced any further, as the output **Q** is not simply inverted **d**, since the output will not be changed until the `clk` rising edge, hence the flop must be used and an inverter will not deliver the same output.


#### 1. dff_const2.v

- Verilog Code 

```verilog
module dff_const2(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
	begin
		if(reset)
		q <= 1'b1;
	else
		q <= 1'b1;
end

endmodule
```

- Simulation and Synthesis
```bash
iverilog dff_const2.v tb_dff_const2.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_const2.vcd
```

It shows how the output is a constant **High** regardless of the changing **Reset** signal. 

```bash
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog dff_const2.v

abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```
- Design Schematics:



The system was reduced to a wire that is constantly carrying a logical one **1b'1**.

#### 3. dff_const3.v

- Verilog Code 

```verilog
module dff_const3(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
reg q1;

always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
	begin
		q <= 1'b1;

### Unused Outputs Optimizations

In some cases, the desired output of a design might be independant of other outputs that are unutilized; the synthesizer remove these outputs and generate simplier circuits that deliver the exact same function, with less complexity, area and power needs.



#### 1. counter_opt.v

The following is an up-counter RTL, the vrilog code shows that the output `q` is only the rightmost bit (LSB) `assign q = count[0]`, this bit in a counter is expexted to be toggling at each cycle, like a `clk` signal. The synthesizer, thus, removes the rest of `q` bits, and reconstruct the design logic to be using a single flop (i.e. foe `count[0]`) instead of 3 (i.e. for `count[2:0]`).


- Verilog Code 

```verilog
module counter_opt (input clk , input reset , output q);
reg [2:0] count;
assign q = count[0];
always @(posedge clk ,posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		count <= 3'b000;
	else
		count <= count + 1;
end
endmodule
```

- Simulation and Synthesis
```bash
iverilog counter_opt.v tb_counter_opt.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_counter_opt.vcd
```
- Waveform


![111111111111111](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/819d4199-7777-4020-a9c7-6d90c816ec76)



It shows how the output `q` (`count` LSB) toggles as the reset signal goes to low.

```bash
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog counter_opt.v
synth -top counter_opt
dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

Only a single flop was utilized to deliver the desiered output.



#### 2. counter_opt2.v

- Verilog Code 

In this case, all the three `count` bits are used.

```verilog
module counter_opt (input clk , input reset , output q);
reg [2:0] count;
assign q = (count[2:0] == 3'b100);

always @(posedge clk ,posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		count <= 3'b000;
	else
		count <= count + 1;
end

endmodule
```

It shows how the output `q` depends on all the 3 bits of `count`

- Synthesis


```bash
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog counter_opt2.v
synth -top counter_opt
dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

```

All the three bits using 3 flop cells were utilized to deliver the desiered output.


## Day 4
### GLS and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatches

**Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** is running the testbench with the generated netlist as our Design Under Test (dut). As mentioned previously, the functionality of both the RTL and netlist are, supposedly, the same, hence the same testbench is used to examine both files.
GLS is performed to verify the logical correctness after synthesis or to ensure there is no timing violations (if gate-level verilog was time-aware; using delay annotation)

**Synthesis-Simulation Mismatches** is when the simulation output of our RTL and netlist differ, implying a design flaw in our RTL that needs to bed debugged. Mismatches can occur due to various reasons:

- **Missing Sensitivity List** Simulators look for activities, if we state certain signals in our always statement sensitivity list then simulator will look for change in activities of those listed signals only, and ignore the changes in the rest that are not on our sensitivity list

- **Blocking and Non-Blocking Statements**
Blocking assignments (`=`) execute sequentially, with each assignment completing before the next one starts. They are commonly used for combinational logic where the order of execution matters. Non-blocking assignments (`<=`) schedule assignments to occur simultaneously within a procedural block, making them suitable for modeling synchronous sequential logic like registers or flip-flops, where assignments should happen concurrently within a single simulation step.
Mismatches occur when the modeling intent does not align with the actual behavior of the code. For instance, using blocking assignments (=) to model sequential logic, or non-blocking assignments (<=) for combinational logic can lead to simulation mismatches and incorrect behavior, as it may not accurately represent the intended behavior.

- **3) Non-standard verilog coding**

### GLS Flow using iverilog Simulator


![1](https://github.com/mohd-khalid/vsd-hdp/assets/97974068/f20bb3be-7074-417f-ac8b-5cbf3e3de0d7)



### [Lab] SKY130RTL - GLS and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch 

We will use synthesize 2 RTL modelings of a 2:1 mux, and observe the RTL and netlist functionalty match.

To perform GLS using iverilog, we use the following command form: `iverilog <lib_verilog_models_path> <netlist.v> <testbench.v>`

#### 1. ternary_operator_mux.v

The following verilog snippit represents the simplest modeling of a 2:1 multiplexer, which uses the verilog ternary oprtator (**?**) in the form: `<condition>?<true>:<false>`.

- Verilog

```verilog
module ternary_operator_mux (input i0 , input i1 , input sel , output y);
	assign y = sel?i1:i0;

RTL Simulation and GLS are matched.




#### 2. bad_mux.v

Here, the incomplete sensitivty list results in a flop-like behaviour as other signals are sampled only at the instant `sel` changes at.

- Verilog

```verilog

## Day 5

The objective is to ensure that the RTL and netlist, when given the same stimuli, will produce the same output. We will initiate by simulating the RTL on iverilog using the corresponding testbench. Then the design will be synthesized (using Yosys), and the resulting netlist will be similarly simulated and verified using the same testbench. We then will closely observe the resulting waveforms to confirm both the RTL and netlist function flawlessly correspond.




### Pre- and Post-Synthesis Functionality Simulation

Firstly the design RTL is simulated. Source code was optained from this [GitHub repositry](https://github.com/vinayrayapati/rv32i). Then we synthesize the design and simulate the resulted netlist. Then we check for any mismatches between the two waveforms.

- _All the steps and commands are already in introduced in the prior sections._

The RTL and Netlist showed identiacl results, hence we can proceed to the following stages; now that the RTL and netlist are verified.


### _Simulated Instructions_

To verify the core is functioning properly we are going to take a closer look at the waveforms of the instructions simulated previously.

- instructions (Extracted from the RTL)

```verilog
always @(posedge RN) begin
MEM[0] <= 32'h02208300;         // add r6,r1,r2.(i1)
MEM[1] <= 32'h02209380;         //sub r7,r1,r2.(i2)
MEM[2] <= 32'h0230a400;         //and r8,r1,r3.(i3)
MEM[3] <= 32'h02513480;         //or r9,r2,r5.(i4)
MEM[4] <= 32'h0240c500;         //xor r10,r1,r4.(i5)
MEM[5] <= 32'h02415580;         //slt r11,r2,r4.(i6)
MEM[6] <= 32'h00520600;         //addi r12,r4,5.(i7)
MEM[7] <= 32'h00209181;         //sw r3,r1,2.(i8)
MEM[8] <= 32'h00208681;         //lw r13,r1,2.(i9)
MEM[9] <= 32'h00f00002;         //beq r0,r0,15.(i10)
MEM[25] <= 32'h00210700;         //add r14,r2,r2.(i11)
end
```
We can see the assemply commands commented out next to their hexadecimal machine-language equivalent.The first line is an addition instruction `add r6,r1,r2`. It will be fetched, decoded then executed; each in a cycle subsequently. The buses `ID_EX_A` and `ID_EX_B` carry the operands of the addition operation, and `EX_MEM_ALUOUT` represents the ALU output (the sum) of the operation [1 + 2 = 3].

--- 


Another instruction to observe is the branching and how the program counter would behave in response. The instruction `beq r0, r0, 15` stands for "Branch if Equal". `beq` is the opcode, `r0, r0` are the registers being compared and `15` is the offset or target address where the program will branch if the two registers are equal. So, the instruction means "Branch to the instruction located 15 instructions away if register r0 is equal to register r0. In this case, the condition will always be true, and the program will always branch to the target address located 15 instructions ahead.

- The simulation shows the activation of the Branch Enable signal `BR_EN` and how the program counter jumbed from `0000000C_H` to `00000019_H` instead of prceeding sequentially to `0000000D_H` because the branching condition was found to be true.

## Day 6
### Post-Synthesis STA using OpenSTA

In this step we will perform our initial timing analysis on our synthesized netlist. To examine various PVT corners, two different libraries will be used: 1. Typical `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80` and 2. Fast `sky130_fd_sc_hd__ff_n40C_1v95`. We will see how the netlist behaviour will consequently change.

In a flow similer to iVerilog and Yosys; we upload the library, RTL design  and timing constraints `.sdc` to  OpenSTA. Then we get our timing reports.

### `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80` Library

## Day 7

### Static Timing Analysis

Static Timing Analysis (STA) is a critical step in digital circuit design to ensure proper timing behavior. Central to STA are constraints regarding minimum (min) and maximum (max) delay, which determine the timing characteristics of the circuit. Delay in semiconductor devices occurs during voltage level transitions, influenced by current inflow. Faster current sources lead to shorter delays and quicker transitions. Additionally, delay is proportional to load capacitance. Thus, circuit delay depends on input transitions and output loads.

Long nets or multiple gate connections increase capacitance, elongating delays as a result.

**Timing Arcs:**
Timing arcs represent paths through which signals propagate in a circuit. These arcs delineate the relationships between input and output signals and are crucial for analyzing timing constraints.

**Constraints:**
Timing Paths play a pivotal role in defining constraints.

1. **Critical Path:** Determines the clock frequency (f_clk) by identifying the longest delay.

**Constraining the Design:**
Ensuring acceptable delay across circuit paths and synchronized clock signals reaching all registers simultaneously is essential.

**Timing Paths:**
Timing paths are routes that signals take through a digital circuit from input to output. They consist of start and end points.

**Start Points:**
- Input ports
- Clock pins of registers (clk)

**End Points:**
- Output ports
- D pins of flip-flops (dFF/dLatch)

**Path Types:**
- **Reg2Reg:** Path between registers.
- **IO Timing Path:** From clock to output or input to D pin of a dFF.
- **Undesired Path:** Input to output.

**Frequency Specification:**
Rather than deducing frequency from delay, designers specify the desired operating frequency. The clock period defines the delay limits in reg2reg paths, with the Synthesizer optimizing logic accordingly.

**Clock Synchronous Paths:**
Constraints are set for input and output delays in synchronous paths which are paths that operate on the same clock signal.

**Constraint Types:**
1. **Reg2Reg:** Constrained by clock.
2. **Reg2Out:** Constrained by output external delay, output load, and clock period.
3. **In2Reg:** Constrained by input external delay, input transition, and clock period.

**IO Constraints:**
Modeling IO delays alone is insufficient due to non-zero rising times. Input transition and output load effects must be considered to avoid timing violations. These factors are included in synthesis constraints based on design specifications.

### Exploring `.lib`

- On the circuit level, the input of a logic gate is connected to the gate terminal of the MOSFET which has a capacitance. So, in a gate with high fan-out, the capacitances of the gate output, next-stage and net will add up. `C_load = C_out.pin + C_net + sum(C_in.pin)`. As stated previously, delay is a function of output capacitance. High fan-out will, thus, result in high delay. To avoid that, cell libraries set max capacitance limits (1.5 pF). It can be overwritten in the design constraints. However, in case of large nets the capacitances will still accumulate, that is why the Synthesizer buffers the net and splits it into smaller nets where gates drive a smaller number of gates.

- **Delay model: Look-up table:** Delay is f(input transition, output load). A delay Look-up table has various values of input transition and output load, and the resulting cell delay of each combination. For values that are not in the table, the tool will perform interpolation on the closest delay values and calculate the delay.

- The .lib defines each cell with multiple **attributes** such as area, power, input and output pins, clock pins, functionality and more.

- **Unateness:** Unateness in digital logic refers to the property of a logical function or a signal where the function or signal is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing with respect to one or more of its input variables. In other words, a unate function or signal either rises or falls as its input variables change, but not both. Unateness can be defined for both positive unate functions (which strictly increase as the variable increases) and negative unate functions (which strictly decrease as the variable increases). Unateness is an important for optimization, especially in the context of logic synthesis and technology mapping. By identifying unate functions within a larger logical network, designers can exploit the unate nature of these functions, leading to more efficient implementations in terms of area, power, and performance.



## Day 8

### Constraints

**Clock Constraints**

We need to constrain the clock period to accommodate the combinational delay in Reg2Reg paths. In the early  ASIC implementation stages, we assume the clk signal to propagate through an ideal network, and the clk single reaches all the circuit elements simultaneously. However, actual clock distribution happens during Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), where the clock signal does not reach all parts of the circuit at the same instant.

#### _Clock Generation_

Sources of clock generation include:

- Oscillator
- PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)
- External clock source

All these sources have inherent variations in the clock period due to stochastic effects **(jitters)**. These variations must be considered in timing analysis and delay margin calculations:
 
![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_{\text{clk}}-T_{\text{jitter}}\geq%20T_{\text{cq}}+T_{\text{comb}}+T_{\text{setup}})

#### Clock Distribution

The clock triggers different parts of the circuit at different times, resulting in clock skew (variations in delay). Flops placed in different parts of the chip have different clock delays. This skew must be considered:

![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T_{\text{clk}}-T_{\text{skew}}\geq%20T_{\text{cq}}+T_{\text{comb}}+T_{\text{setup}})

#### Clock Skew

The physical clock tree is built during CTS, while logic optimization happens during synthesis assuming an ideal clock. Timing-clean paths in synthesis might fail post-CTS due to skew.

#### Clock Modeling

Consider the following in clock modeling:

- **Source latency:** Time taken by the clock to generate the signal.
- **Network latency:** Time taken by the clock distribution network.
- **Clock uncertainty:**
- **1. Clock skew:** Path delay mismatches causing variations in clock arrival time. CTS optimizes the clock to minimize skew, but it won't be zero.
- **2. Jitters:** Random variations in clock period (T_clk) and duty cycle (T_on/T_clk). 

The modeled skew and network latency must be removed post-CTS. The only acceptable clock uncertainty post-CTS is jitters; skew is not acceptable.

#### _Constraining Designs in DC_

Constraints are provided to Design Compiler (DC) in the form of Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC).

To create a clock in DC:

```tcl
create_clock -name {clock name} -period {period} [get_ports CLK]
```

Clocks must be created on:

- Clock generators (PLL, oscillator)
- Primary IO pins (in case of external clock)

Clocks must not be created on hierarchical pins that are not clock generators.

Practicalities of the clock network:

- **Latency:** `set_clock_latency (period) (clk name)`
- **Uncertainty:** (jitters + skew, jitters only post-CTS) `set_clock_uncertainty 0.5 (name)`

#### IO Paths Constraints

- Maximum and minimum input delay
- Maximum and minimum input transition
- Maximum and minimum output delay
- Maximum and minimum output load

#### Generated Clocks


For any hardware module with input and output clock pins, there is a propagation delay for the clock signal to travel across the chip (time of flight). Ideally, it is the same clock on both ports (`clk_in` & `clk_out`). However, at the physical level, due to delays, generated clocks are used. New clocks are introduced on the circuit that operates with the original master clock in the primary port (e.g., PLL or oscillators). Additionally, the module's primary output should be constrained by the output clock.

**Virtual Clocks:**  Virtual clocks are created without a definition point.

## Day 9
### Post-Synthesis STA using OpenSTA (Revisited)

Now that the main concepts of STA and design constraints are covered; a refined analysis will be executed across multiple PVT corners. The obtained data is then visualized in graphs to provide a good understanding of the system behaviour across different process, voltage and tempreture corners. The parameters to be computed are TNS, WNS, WSS and WHS.

In order to automate the STA process across the PVTs, the following `.tcl` scrtipt is used:

```tcl
set pvt_corner(1) "sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib"
set pvt_corner(2) "sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_100C_1v80.lib"

set pvt_corner(13) "sky130_fd_sc_hd__ss_n40C_1v40.lib"
set pvt_corner(14) "sky130_fd_sc_hd__ss_n40C_1v44.lib"
set pvt_corner(15) "sky130_fd_sc_hd__ss_n40C_1v60.lib"
set pvt_corner(16) "sky130_fd_sc_hd__ss_n40C_1v76.lib"

for {set i 1} {$i <= 16} {incr i} {
read_liberty ../lib/$pvt_corner($i)

puts "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~STA Done!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~";

exit
```

The following `.sdc` constraints were used for clock and IO constraints:

```sdc
create_clock -name clk -period 10 [get_ports {clk}]
set_clock_latency 1 [get_clocks clk]
set_clock_uncertainty 0.5 clk 

set_input_delay -min 0.5 -clock [get_clocks clk] [get_ports RN]

set_output_delay -clock clk -min 0.1 [get_ports WB_OUT]
set_output_delay -clock clk -max 0.4 [get_ports WB_OUT]
```


### 1. TNS (Total Negative Slack)
Total Negative Slack is the sum of all the negative slacks in a design. Slack is the difference between the required time and the arrival time of a signal. A negative slack indicates that the signal is arriving later than required, which means there is a timing violation.


![TNS (Total Negative Slack)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47d50ba1-d443-4012-8d75-572ccdedb0b2)


### 2. WNS (Worst Negative Slack)
Worst Negative Slack is the most negative slack value in the design. It indicates the most severe timing violation, showing the path that is furthest from meeting its timing requirements.


![WNS (Worst Negative Slack)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32dbe108-bfd4-456c-ad0d-001a016e17e6)


### 3. Worst Minimum and Maximum Slack
These terms are used to describe the worst-case slack values for the minimum and maximum timing paths in the design. The minimum slack typically refers to setup timing (data arriving late), and the maximum slack often refers to hold timing (data arriving early).

- **Worst Minimum Slack:** This refers to the worst slack (most negative) observed for the _**setup timing**_ paths. It's the most negative slack among all the setup paths in the design.

- **Worst Maximum Slack:** This typically refers to the worst slack observed for the _**hold timing**_ paths, though it can also refer to other maximum path constraints. It's the most negative slack among all the hold paths in the design.

In summary:
- **TNS** gives an overall measure of timing issues in the design.
- **WNS** identifies the worst single timing violation.
- **Worst Minimum Slack** highlights the worst setup timing path.
- **Worst Maximum Slack** highlights the worst hold timing path (or other maximum constraint paths).


## Day 10
### Inception of Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE, and Sky130 PDK

The design of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) has evolved into an automated process involving RTL IPs, Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, and Process Design Kits (PDKs). Achieving a fully open-source, fabrication-ready ASIC has been a long-standing goal.

### Examples of Open-Source Chip Design Enablers:

![Screenshot from 2024-07-31 23-24-47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c4413b0-ea66-463c-b92c-e52fced71461)

**RTL:** Numerous open-source RTL designs are available online on platforms like librecores.org, opencores.org, and many GitHub repositories.

**EDA:** Early EDA tools emerged from academic research and have been open-sourced since then. Notable examples include SPICE Simulator, Magic, and more recently, OpenROAD and OpenLANE.

**PDK Data:** A PDK serves as the interface between fabrication facilities and designers. It comprises files used to model a fabrication process for EDA tools, including process design rules (DRC, LVS, PEX, etc.), device models, digital standard cell libraries, IO libraries, and more. Traditionally, this sensitive information was licensed under NDAs (non-disclosure agreements). However, in a groundbreaking move, Google open-sourced the SkyWater PDK for their 130nm process, marking the release of the first-ever open-source PDK on June 30th, 2020.


- ### _**Historical Context:**_
    Until the late 1970s, design and fabrication were closely coupled and practiced by a few companies. In 1979, Conway and Mead proposed separating design from fabrication technology, leading to the emergence of Pure Play (fab-only) and Fabless (design-only) companies. 
    
With the open-sourcing of all necessary elements for ASIC design and fabrication (RTLs, EDA tools, and PDKs), these resources are now accessible to everyone.
